This repo contains the solutions to the problems posed originally from the book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686/ref=ed_oe_p">"The Elements of Computing Systems"</a>.

All lessons can be found on the nand2tetris <a href="http://nand2tetris.org/course.php">website</a>.

Relevant code can be found with the .hdl file type in the projects folder. The Hardware Descriptor Language used in this tutorial is not fully complete like Verilog or VHDL, but nonetheless serves the same purpose of demonstrating what goes on beneath the hood.
